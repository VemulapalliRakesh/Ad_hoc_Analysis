## About the Company: 
**Atliq Hardwares** (imaginary company) is one of India's leading computer hardware producers and well expanded in other countries.
## Problem Statement:
The management noticed they do not get enough insights to make quick, smart data-informed decisions. They have decided to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director, wanted to hire someone good at tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both skills.
## Task:
1️⃣Our Task is to run SQL queries to answer 10 ad-hoc requests for which the business needs insights.

2️⃣The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management, hence we need to create a presentation to show the insights.

As a Junior Data Analyst, my task is to write SQL queries to answer all 10 ad-hoc requests and convert them into visualizations and present them in front of the management so that they can get valuable and accurate insights to take crucial business decisions.
